# fraudDetectionML

 This fraud detection machine learning application is trained on a large dataset of synthesized financial transactions 
 and utilizes a logistic regression algorithm to discern patterns in order to predict with high accuracy whether or not 
 a transaction is fraudulent.
 
The function to run the application is in the last line of code:
runLogisticML(testFile)

You can run the notebook as is with the included sample data (“fraudSampleData.csv”) or you can upload your own transaction 
data by replacing the filename in the User Interface.
